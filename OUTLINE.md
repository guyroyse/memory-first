# Memory First

- **Introduction** (slides):
	- Who is this Guy?
	- What are we gonna talk about?
- **What is Redis** (slides):
	- It's a cache:
		- Stores stuff in memory
		- It's stupid fast
	- It's a key value store:
		- Stores stuff in memory *first*
		- But it can be persisted, replicated, and clustered
	- It's a gaint hash table that stores data structures:
		- Overview of the data structures (the big slide showing all the types)
		- What I like is that it stores stuff the way we use stuff in our code
		- So we're gonna talk about four of them that we use in our code all the time:
			- Strings, Lists, Hashes, and Sets
	- It's extensible:
		- You can write modules to add new data structures and commands
		- We've written a few: notably Search, JSON, and Bloom
- **Talking to Redis** (slides transitioning to demo):
	- You send it commands over a socket, it responds (slides)
	- The RESP protocol (slide and then transition to demo)
	- Talking to Redis redis-cli (demo)
	- Talking to Redis using RedisInsight (demo)
	- Talking to Redis from code: C#, Java, JavaScript, Python
- **Strings from C#**:
	- What it is: a block of memory
	- SET and GET
	- They're actually BLOBs: demo from the command line
	- But sometimes they're integers: INCR, DECR, INCRBY, DECRBY
	- Managing keys
		- Existence: EXISTS
		- Listing keys: KEYS vs SCAN
		- Removing keys
			- The most dangerous command: FLUSHALL
			- DEL vs UNLINK
		- Expiring keys: EXPIRE and TTL
	- Doing it from C#
		- StackExchange.Redis
		- Connecting to Redis
		- Sending commands
- **Lists from Java**:
	- What it is: a doubly-linked list
	- PUSH and POP
	- Stores strings so actually BLOBs (or integers)
	- Get a single idem from the list with LINDEX
	- Get a slice of the list with LRANGE
	- Fancier PUSH and POP with LMOVE
		- LMOVE to yourself
	- Doing it from Java
		- Jedis
		- Connecting to Redis
		- Sending commands
- **Hashes from JavaScript**:
	- What it is: a hash table
	- HSET, HGET, and HDEL
	  Getting moar: HMGET, HGETALL
	- Stores strings so actually BLOBs (or integers)
		- HINCRBY
	- Removing with HDEL
	- Doing it from JavaScript
		- Node Redis
		- Connecting to Redis
		- Sending commands
- **Sets from Python**:
	- What is it: a set
	- SADD, SMEMBERS, SREM
	- Stores Strings too, so acutally BLOBs
	- Membership with SISMEMBER
	- Cardinality with SCARD
	- Unions, Intersections, and Differences with SUNION, SINTER, SDIFF
	- Doing it from Python
		- redis-py
		- Connecting
		- Sending commands
- **Summary** (slides):
	- We looked at what:
		- How to talk to Redis
		- Some of the things we can store in Redis
	- How to get all this stuff:
		- Redis Stack
		- Redis Insight
- **Thanks!**
